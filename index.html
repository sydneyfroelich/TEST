				<p> Too many vacant properties can cause a “community to implode,” Says Town Supervisor of Salina, Nicholas Paro.</p>

				<p>Syracuse, New York is home to more than 1,000 vacant properties, both commercial and residential. The average number of vacancies per neighborhood is 45.9 however the neighborhood of Brighton exceeds that number.</p>

				<p>With 226 vacancies and an average vacancy rate of <a href="https://bestneighborhood.org/housing-data-in-brighton-syracuse-ny/">28.66%,</a> Brighton Syracuse has the highest number of vacancies in Syracuse, a concerning statistic for potential buyers and homeowners. Higher rates of vacancies lead to the likelihood of squatters, property value decline, and a lower probability of investment in the neighborhood.</p>

				<p>Economic factors contribute to Brighton’s high vacancy rate. Nearly <a href= "https://locallogic.co/insights/US-NY/Syracuse/Brighton">one in five</a> residents earn <a href="https://locallogic.co/insights/US-NY/Syracuse/Brighton/">less than $10,000 annually</a>, with an average family income of about <a href="https://locallogic.co/insights/US-NY/Syracuse/Brighton/">$36,000</a> and an individual income of roughly <a href="https://locallogic.co/insights/US-NY/Syracuse/Brighton/">$17,000</a>. Despite most residents being employed, the neighborhood still faces a significant unemployment rate of more than <a href="https://locallogic.co/insights/US-NY/Syracuse/Brighton/">16%</a>.</p>

				<p>According to the Town Supervisor of Salina Nicholas Paro, Brighton is a low-income community, so it is more difficult for people to buy or rent unless it’s subsidized housing.</p>

				<p>Among the empty homes in Brighton, those properties are broken down into residential and commercial.

				<p>Residential properties are built for people to live in. The numerous vacant residential properties left in disrepair contribute to the low property value and make it harder to attract buyers. On the other hand, commercial properties serve as buildings for business spaces and storefronts. Considering the high unemployment rate and lack of active businesses in the neighborhood, Brighton is in a period of economic stagnation.</p>

				<p>Paro explained that affordability and housing trends play a significant role in residential vacancies:</p>

				<p>“One reason could be the affordability of housing. Another reason could also be housing trends… You have larger families living in smaller homes and sometimes they’re doing that because it’s their family structure or sometimes they’re doing that because the affordability of homes is out of reach. Hence, this allows them to save money until they’re able to afford a home,” Paro said. </p>
            
            	<p>The Greater Syracuse Property Development Corporation (GSPDC) owns the most vacant properties in all of Syracuse. The GSPDC is a nonprofit organization that invested $3 million in efforts to renovate and resell homes, and demolish damaged properties, aiming to boost property values and revitalize neighborhoods.</p>
